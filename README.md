# Title: WebGIS Integrated Infrastructure Management: Valves, Pipelines, and Buildings

**Description:** I focused on managing valves, pipelines, and buildings through a structured web GIS project. I applied front-end and back-end skills to build two versions of a web portal: a simple version utilizing only front-end technologies and a sophisticated version integrating back-end repairs and real-time data capabilities. This comprehensive development experience bridges the gap between theory and practical application in real-world scenarios.

**Core Technologies Used Front-end Development:**

**HTML & CSS:** I build the structure of web pages using HTML, allowing for the arrangement of content in a logical manner and CSS was utilized to enhance the visual appeal and layout of your web applications. 

**JavaScript:** I used JavaScript for making the web pages interactive. It was used to respond to user actions, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and create dynamic content without needing to reload the page.

**Bootstrap:** Frameworks like Bootstrap was used for responsive design, ensuring the interface looks good on any device. It makes visually appealing, improving the overall interface.

**jQuery:** This library simplified JavaScript tasks, making it easier to handle events, animate elements, and manage data without complicated code. It helped streamline interactions with the front-end components, simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling, making your web applications more dynamic.

**Leaflet:** I integrated Leaflet to create interactive maps, enabling users to visualize and interact with spatial data. This included adding markers, pop-ups, and layers to display various data types.

**Back-end:** For handling data, I work with PHP and SQL (PostgreSQL) as backend technologies to manage spatial data analysis and backend interactions.

**Core Technologies Used Back-end Development:**

**PHP:** As the primary server-side language, PHP was used to handle requests from the front-end. I implemented logic for user authentication, data processing, and serving content dynamically.

**PostgreSQL:** I managed a database using PostgreSQL, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) spatial data. This included connecting your web application to the database and ensuring data integrity.

**CRUD Operations:** The portal will support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for spatial data in real-time. This means that updates made by one user will be instantly visible to all other users interacting with the portal, enhancing the user experience.

**AJAX:** As a method for asynchronous data transfer, AJAX allowed for real-time interactions, meaning updates on the front-end could reflect changes made on the back-end without refreshing the page. This was crucial for enhancing user experience, especially in applications where real-time data handling is required.

**Data Handling:** I implemented mechanisms for real-time data handling, allowing users to see updates almost instantaneously. This is important for application functionality where multiple users can interact with data concurrently.
